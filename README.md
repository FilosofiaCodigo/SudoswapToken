# Sudoswap Token

Sudoswap is a highly innovative protocol that combines familiar ideas in a unique way. It allows for the buying and selling of NFTs like any other marketplace, but it does so using liquidity pools, similar to those found on Uniswap. This makes Sudoswap a valuable platform to explore for those interested in the NFT market. In this video, I will explain the general functioning of Sudoswap and also share a bit of my work and experience with this protocol.
